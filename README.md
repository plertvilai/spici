# spcserver

SPCServer - Downloads and uploads data to spc.ucsd.edu

## System requirement

1. Python 3.5 or higher
2. Example: Create a python environment named 'spici_env' and install required libraries using pip:
    - `virtualenv spici_env`
    - `source spici_env/bin/activate`
    - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Conda also works as well.

## Usage

Run `spc_go.py` to download images from the spc.ucsd.edu. 
Create an `SPCServer` to upload images to the spc.ucsd.edu


### Download
The input requires one file:
1. A search parameter text file containing the start and end dates, minimum/maximum organism length, and camera choice


This example shows you how to both download and upload images to spc.ucsd.edu using python.
```
    python spc_go.py --search-param-file=examples/summer2019/time_period.txt --image-output-path=examples/summer2019/images --meta-output-path=examples/summer2019/meta_data.csv -d
```

This downloads images for the 3 following time intervals to `examples/summer2019/images`
```
    2019-05-23 09:53:00,2019-05-23 10:27:00,0.03,1.0,SPCP2
    2019-05-28 10:11:00,2019-05-28 10:45:00,0.03,1.0,SPCP2
    2019-05-30 09:58:00,2019-05-30 10:32:00,0.03,1.0,SPCP2
```
It will also output the meta data csv file to `examples/summer2019/meta_data.csv`

The output consists of two files:

1. A meta data file (in csv file formating) containing the image's id, min/max length, timestamp, etc.
2. A collection of images pulled from the website based off the desired search parameters.

```

Number of results: 2708
Number of results: 573
...
..
.
Downloaded 39538 images in 0:01:29.012763 (444 images/sec)
```
### Generate random dates
To randomly sample data from the SPC server, run the script called `generate_dates.py`
Note that the parameters in the config has to be changed to the desired parameters before running the script.
Also, specify the name of the output text file in the parameter `output_csv`. 

```
output_csv = "./examples/time_period.txt"
config = {
        "start_date": "2021-01-01",
        "end_date": "2021-08-30",
        "n_dates": 100,
        "start_time": "18:00",
        "offset_hours": 5,
        "offset_min": 0,
        "min_camera": 0.03,
        "max_camera": 1.0,
    }
```
When the config is modified, run the script with 
```
python generate_dates.py
```
and the output text file will be generated. 


### Upload
The input requires two files:

1. A predictions text file containing the image file names and their respective enumerated labels
2. A labels text file containing the enumerated labels mapped to their class names

Once you have images ready to be uploaded, you can create an `SPCServer` 
object and use its method
`upload` to upload your desired images with their labels.

An example is provided below:

`#todo give explanation of example`

```
# Create SPCServer
spc = SPCServer()

# Initialize inputs
account_info = {'username': 'kevin', 'password': 'ceratium'}
login_url = 'http://spc.ucsd.edu/data/admin/?next=/data/admin'
predictions = 'examples/prorocentrum/predictions.txt'
label_file = 'examples/prorocentrum/labels.txt'

# Initialize submission dictionary parameters
spc.submit_dict['name'] = 'kevin_test'  # NAME OF LABELING INSTANCE
spc.submit_dict['tag'] = 'kevin_test'
spc.submit_dict['is_machine'] = True  # BOOL FOR MACHINE UPLOAD. IF FALSE, USES USER LOG-IN AS ANNOTATOR NAME
spc.submit_dict['machine_name'] = 'kevin_test'

# Upload images
spc.upload(login_url=login_url,
           account_info=account_info,
           textfile=predictions,
           label_file=label_file)
```
